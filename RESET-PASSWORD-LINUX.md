- Mothod one (hard, but nothing but a keyboard required)
  - Reboot/Boot while constantly pressing shift
  - Press [e]
  - Go to the line starting with "linux"
  - Add " rw init=/bin/bash" at the end of the line
  - Press [Ctrl] + [x]
  - Wait for "bash {some number}# " to show up
  - Type "passwd root{enter}"
  - Type "rootroot{enter}" (it will be invisible)
  - Type "rootroot{enter}" again
  - Type "touch /.autorelabel"
  - Type "/sbin/reboot -f{enter}"
  - The PC will restart (can take pretty long, however).
  - (Eventually, you need to restart it again (manually), after that)
  - See, that is worked! Your root password is "rootroot", now!

- Method two (easy, but you need an usb stick you can write to)
  - Install Lubuntu on the usb stick (If on linux, just type `curl http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/16.04/release/lubuntu-16.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso | dd of=/dev/sd{{{abcd...}}}` (Replace {{{abcd...}}} with the entry of your usb drive))
  - Boot from that stick on the machine you want to reset the password of
  - Select 'Try Lubuntu'
  - Wait for it to boot
  - Open up the file explorer
  - To the left, select the main drive with the linux OS
  - Copy the mount point (the address bar)
  - Open up a terminal
  - Type `chroot {{{the mount point here}}}`
  - Type `passwd root`
  - Type your new password two times
  - You are done. Reboot and see that it worked!
